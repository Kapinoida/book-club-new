## Architecture Decisions

### Database Design

- **PostgreSQL** chosen for complex relational data
- **Prisma** for type-safe database operations
- Proper indexing on frequently queried fields
- Soft deletes for user-generated content
- Audit trails for admin actions

### Authentication Strategy

- **NextAuth.js** with database sessions for security
- **Google OAuth** as primary authentication method
- **Email-based admin authorization** for simplicity
- **JWT tokens** for API authentication

### Performance Considerations

- **Static generation** where possible
- **Incremental Static Regeneration** for dynamic content
- **Database connection pooling** via Prisma
- **Image optimization** with Next.js Image component
- **Lazy loading** for non-critical components

### Security Implementation

- **CSRF protection** via NextAuth.js
- **SQL injection protection** via Prisma
- **XSS protection** via React's built-in sanitization
- **Authentication middleware** for protected routes
- **Input validation** with Zod schemas
- **Rate limiting** on API endpoints

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Development Issues

```bash
# Database connection issues
npx prisma db push --accept-data-loss

# NextAuth configuration problems
# Check NEXTAUTH_URL matches your development URL
# Verify Google OAuth redirect URIs

# Build failures
npm run lint                  # Check for code issues
npx prisma generate          # Regenerate database client
rm -rf .next && npm run build # Clean build

# Environment variable issues
cp .env.example .env.local   # Reset environment template
```

### Production Debugging

```bash
# Check deployment logs
vercel logs

# Database connectivity
npx prisma db push --preview-feature

# Environment variables
vercel env ls
```

This comprehensive guide should serve as your complete reference for developing the Book Club Management Platform with Claude Code. The roadmap is designed to build features incrementally while maintaining code quality and user experience throughout the development process.
